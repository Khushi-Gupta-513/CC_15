## Portfolio Management System

## This project is a simple portfolio management system built with JavaScript ES6 modules. It includes three main modules:

## Asset Module (`asset.js`): Manages an array of assets and provides a function to retrieve asset details by ID.
## Portfolio Module (`portfolio.js`): Calculates total portfolio value and asset allocation percentage.
## Transaction Module (`transaction.js`): Defines a `Transaction` class for buying or selling assets, updating quantities accordingly.

## The main application (`main.js`) executes and displays portfolio values, allocations, and transaction outcomes. This project demonstrates modular code structure, object-oriented programming, and financial logic.
